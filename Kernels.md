# AcreetionOS Kernels
Are you wondering how AcreetionOS builds their *custom* kernels? We use TKT, brought to us by our friend, ETJAKEOC, who forked it from the TKG Project.

# Variants

We have a default kernel, which comes from Arch Linux, in our Mirror. But we are trying to add support for custom kernels, for those that want them.

We include support for the Zen Kernel, which is also within the repo, for those who want *quick and easy* options.

But for those who want to get their hands dirty, we have decided to build some of the *custom* kernel packages, with custom schedulers for users. We are including the following:

We have two variants of our kernel, for power users, are the EEVDF and Bore versions. Are you wondering what those even are? Well, more can be found about [BORE](https://github.com/firelzrd/bore-scheduler) and [EEVDF](https://lwn.net/Articles/925371/). by offering both kernels, we are offering choice to the power user. If you don't know what any of this means, the default kernel is installed, which allows for you to experiment and have a fallback. So, if you break it, there is a backup there just in case!
